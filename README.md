# WoP-CharacterControllerBase
The base components of a modular character controller system used in 'Wake of Poseidon'

This was a highly game-specfici character controller that took into account custom gravity and inertia as well as a skewed perspective camera. If you want a more generic character controller, check out my other repo [here](https://github.com/Slugronaut/Toolbox-CharacterController)
